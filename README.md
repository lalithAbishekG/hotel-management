Hotel Management System
Welcome to the Hotel Management System! ðŸŽ‰ This handy Python app helps you manage your hotelâ€™s room reservations with ease. Hereâ€™s a quick overview of what you can do with it:

What You Can Do
1. View Rooms
Open a window to see a table with all room details, including room ID, current status, guest name, and room service status.
If there are no rooms or data yet, youâ€™ll just see the table headersâ€”no empty rows cluttering your view.
2. Check In a Guest
Easily check in a guest by providing the room ID and their name. The app will update the roomâ€™s status to â€˜Occupiedâ€™ and show the guestâ€™s name.
3. Check Out a Guest
To check out a guest, simply enter the room ID. The room will be marked as â€˜Vacantâ€™ and the guestâ€™s name will be set to â€˜emptyâ€™.
4. Add a New Room
Want to add a new room? Just enter a room ID, and the room will be added to the system. Each room ID must be unique.
How to Get Started
Make Sure You Have the Essentials:

Python 3.x installed on your computer.
Tkinter (which comes with Python).
SQLite (also included with Python).
Run the App:

Clone this repository to your computer.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
Run the application with this command:
bash
Copy code
python hotel_management_app.py
How It Works
Database Setup
The app creates a SQLite database called hotel_management.db with a rooms table. This table has columns for room ID, guest name, and room status.
Viewing Rooms
A new window shows a table with room details. If thereâ€™s no data, youâ€™ll only see the column headers.
Checking In
Opens a dialog where you enter the room ID and guest name. The app updates the roomâ€™s status and guest name accordingly.
Checking Out
Opens a dialog where you enter the room ID. The app updates the roomâ€™s status to â€˜Vacantâ€™ and sets the guest name to â€˜emptyâ€™.
Adding a Room
Opens a dialog to enter a new room ID. The room is then added to the database.
The Interface
When you launch the app, youâ€™ll see a main window with buttons for each function:

View Rooms: See all rooms in a new window.
Check In: Opens a dialog to check in a guest.
Check Out: Opens a dialog to check out a guest.
Add Room: Opens a dialog to add a new room.
